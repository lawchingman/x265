Introduction
************

Increasing demand for high definition and ultra-high definition video,
along with an increasing desire for video on demand has led to
exponential growth in demand for bandwidth and storage requirements.
These challenges can be met by the new High Efficiency Video Coding
(HEVC) standard, also known as H.265. The x265 HEVC encoder project was
launched by MulticoreWare in 2013, aiming to provide the most efficient,
highest performance HEVC video encoder.

About HEVC
==========

The High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) was developed by the ISO/IEC
Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) and ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group
(VCEG), through their Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC).
HEVC is also known as ISO/IEC 23008-2 MPEG-H Part 2 and ITU-T H.265.
HEVC provides superior video quality and up to twice the data
compression as the previous standard (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC).  HEVC can
support 8K Ultra High Definition video, with a picture size up to
8192x4320 pixels.

Benefits of HEVC
================

HEVC offers several benefits over previous video coding standards:

1. **Higher Compression Efficiency**: HEVC can achieve up to 50% better compression than H.264, which means it can deliver the same video quality at half the bitrate or double the video quality at the same bitrate.
2. **Support for Higher Resolutions**: HEVC supports resolutions up to 8K UHD (8192x4320), making it suitable for the latest high-resolution displays.
3. **Improved Video Quality**: HEVC includes advanced techniques for motion compensation and prediction, which result in better video quality, especially for high-motion content.
4. **Adaptive Streaming**: HEVC is designed to work well with adaptive streaming technologies, allowing for smoother playback on a variety of devices and network conditions.

About x265
==========

The primary objective of x265 is to become the best H.265/HEVC encoder
available anywhere, offering the highest compression efficiency and the
highest performance on a wide variety of hardware platforms. The x265
encoder is available as an open source library, published under the
GPLv2 license. It is also available under a commercial license, enabling
commercial companies to utilize and distribute x265 in their solutions
without being subject to the restrictions of the GPL license.

Advantages of Using x265
========================

1. **High Compression Efficiency**: x265 is designed to provide the highest possible compression efficiency, which means it can deliver high-quality video at lower bitrates.
2. **Performance Optimization**: x265 is optimized for a wide range of hardware platforms, including CPUs with multiple cores and SIMD instructions, as well as GPUs.
3. **Flexibility**: x265 supports a wide range of encoding options and parameters, allowing users to fine-tune the encoding process to meet their specific needs.
4. **Open Source**: x265 is available as an open source project under the GPLv2 license, which means it can be freely used, modified, and distributed.
5. **Commercial Licensing**: For companies that require a commercial license, x265 is available under competitive terms, allowing them to use and distribute x265 without being subject to the GPLv2 license.

x265 is developed by `MulticoreWare <http://www.multicorewareinc.com>`_,
leaders in high performance software solutions, with backing from
leading video technology providers including `Telestream
<http://www.telestream.com>`_ and `Doremi Labs
<http://www.doremilabs.com>`_ (and other companies who want to remain
anonymous at this time), and with contributions from open source
developers.  x265 leverages many of the outstanding video encoding
features and optimizations from the x264 AVC encoder project.

The x265 software is available for free under the GNU GPL 2 license,
from https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265_git.  For commercial companies
that wish to distribute x265 without being subject to the open source
requirements of the GPL 2 license, commercial licenses are available
with competitive terms.  Contact license @ x265.com to inquire about
commercial license terms.  

While x265 is primarily designed as a video encoder software library, a
command-line executable is provided to facilitate testing and
development.  We expect x265 to be utilized in many leading video
hardware and software products and services in the coming months.
